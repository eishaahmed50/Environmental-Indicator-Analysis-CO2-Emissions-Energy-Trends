**Author:** Eisha

## Abstract
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of various environmental indicators, including CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and electricity production from oil sources. The project aims to provide statistical insights and correlations among these critical environmental factors. By employing Python programming and data analysis techniques, this report sheds light on the relationships between these factors and presents their visualizations.

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the trends, correlations, and statistical characteristics of key environmental factors using Python programming and data analysis techniques. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and oil-based electricity production. By visualizing and analyzing these relationships, we aim to contribute insights to inform environmental sustainability and energy planning decisions.

It's important to acknowledge the limitations of the dataset and recognize the World Bank as the source of climate change data. The data from the World Bank enables us to succinctly analyze vital environmental factors and better comprehend their interdependencies for the sake of environmental sustainability and energy planning.

## Explanation
This project primarily focuses on statistical analysis of World Bank data concerning the environment. The dataset includes crucial metrics like CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and power production from oil sources as a percentage of total energy.

The workflow involves:
1. Downloading and cleaning CSV files from the World Bank.
2. Utilizing statistical methods (e.g., mean, standard deviation) to understand the data's properties.
3. Determining correlation values to uncover relationships between variables.
4. Employing line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts to visually present data trends.

To implement the analysis, the following libraries are used: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and scipy. Custom functions, such as "read_data," "explore_statistics," and "explore_correlations," are defined to facilitate data manipulation and exploration.

## Interpretation of the Results
The results are presented through various means:
- A table showcasing CO2 emissions and their correlations.
- Line graphs illustrating CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions over time.
- A pie chart depicting the distribution of CO2 emissions within total greenhouse gas emissions.
- A bar graph comparing fossil fuel energy consumption and electricity production from oil sources.

## Conclusion
The analysis of environmental data from the World Bank reveals significant correlations between CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and oil-based electricity production. These findings underscore the importance of considering environmental impacts in energy planning. By leveraging reliable World Bank data and Python programming, this analysis contributes to the validity of the insights provided.
